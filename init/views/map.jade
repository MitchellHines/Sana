For our use case, we can identify - within a given time frame -  the total number of reported Ebola cases and related deaths, date reported, their location, summary of the outbreak, and significance of the outbreak. For the purpose of the application, users can easily identify serious outbreaks of any disease in any country around the world, helping them to identify high-need areas which could influence the direction of their contributions."
