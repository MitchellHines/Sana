              |Sana was created to generate awareness toward the inefficiencies and lack of funding for epidemic relief efforts. Our product aims to allow users to actively participate in the relief effort process, by funneling their contributions directly to verified vendors who can then turn it into physical resources that can assist in the relief effort.
